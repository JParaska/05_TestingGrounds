# 05_TestingGrounds
A Hunger Games inspired FPS with large outdoor terrains, advanced AI, basic networking, pickups, skeletal meshes, checkpoints &amp; more.

This project was created following [Unreal Engine Developer Course | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/).

## Game Development Document

1. Concept
* Player is a contestant in an entertainment game
* Survive as many testing grounds as possible
* Try to reach the end (if there is any)
* Use force or stealth
2. Rules
* Try to pass testing ground undetected
* If detected, clear the area
* You're scored on how many areas you pass
3. Requirements
* Testing grounds scenery
* Props and textures
* A rigged character
* Gun and projectile
4. Challenges
* Procedural generation of grounds
* AI
